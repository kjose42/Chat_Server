HTTPChatServer hosts a server that uses the HTTP protocol in java
The server is initialized with a port from command line
  - server sends back one html file: login.html, chat.html, or error.html
    - login.html: 
      - client attempts to login to the server by sending a message that contains the login.html URL, username, and password
      - credentials.txt stores valid username, password pairs
      - if the client sends a valid username and password, the server stores a cookie for the client
      - if the client sends an invalid username and password, the server sends a 401 error to the client
    - chat.html:
      - can only be accessed if the client has correctly logged in (aka if the client has a cookie)
      - client can send messages that will be seen along with chat.html
      - the message's format in the chat UI is <username>:<message>
      - client messages are stored in allMessages.txt 
        - allMessages.txt will be created once the first message has been posted in the chat
Clients can connect to the server with the right addess and port
  - client_test_1.py is an example of a client
    - python code takes the input of address, port, username, passsword, message
      - address and port is intended to be the server's address and port
      - username and password is the client's login credentials
      - message is the text that the client wants to post in chat
