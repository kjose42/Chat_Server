HTTPChatServer hosts a server
  - server sends back one html file: login.html, chat.html, or error.html
    - login.html: 
      - client attempts to login to the server by sending a message that contains the login.html URL, username, and password
      - credentials.txt stores valid username, password pairs
      - if the client sends a valid username and password, the server stores a cookie for the client
      - if the client sends an invalid username and password, the server sends a 401 error to the client
    - chat.html:
      - can only be accessed if the client has correctly logged in (aka if the client has a cookie)
      - client can send messages that will be seen along with chat.html
      - the message's format in the chat UI is <username>:<message>
      - client messages are stored in allMessages.txt (this file will be created once the first message has been posted in the chat)
Clients can connect to the server with the right addess and port
