HTTPChatServer hosts a server that uses the HTTP protocol
From command line, the server is initialized with a port as input
Clients can connect to the server with the right address and port
  - client_test_1.py is an example of a client
      - python code takes the input of address, port, username, passsword, message
          + address and port is intended to be the server's address and port
          + username and password is the client's login credentials
          + message is the text that the client wants to post in chat
      
4 interactions can occur between server and client:

    - Interaction 1: client sends a GET message requesting the login page
        - client message contains login.html URL
        - server sends login.html
    
    - Interaction 2: client sends a POST message requesting the login page
        - client message contains the login.html URL, username, and password
        - client is attempting to login to the server
        - if the client sends a valid username and password
            + server stores a cookie for the client
            + server sends login.html and the client's cookie
        - if the client sends an invalid username and password
            + server sends error.html with a 401 error
        - credentials.txt stores valid username, password pairs
    
    - Interaction 3: client sends a GET message requesting the chat page
        - client message contains chat.html URL
        - server sends chat.html
        
  - Interaction 4: client sends a POST message requesting the chat page
      - client contains the chat.html URL, client's message, and cookie
      - client is attempting to post text to the chat
      - chat.html can only be accessed if the client has correctly logged in 
          + (aka if the client has an existing cookie)
      - the message's format in the chat UI is <username>:<message>
      - client messages are stored in allMessages.txt 
          + allMessages.txt will be created once the first message has been posted in the chat
      - server sends chat.html, client's cookie, and all the chat messages
